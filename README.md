# Portfolio website for the minor Webdesign and Development
Welcome to my portfoliosite! My portfolio is a bookcase, where the books are my projects/github repositories. The user can click on any shelf and get a more zoomed-in page to see the content better. If you click on the middle shelf on the right, and then click on a book, you'll get to a new page with that specific book/repo with details about the project. To get the best experience, please view my portfolio on a mobile device :)

## :bulb:Api
I used the Github API for this project, which is a RESTful API that allows developers to programmatically interact with GitHub repositories and services. It provides a wide range of endpoints that allow developers to retrieve and manipulate data such as repositories, issues, pull requests, user profiles, and more.
